# 🎯 **FOCUSED PLAN IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

## **Mission Accomplished: Camera Integration + Accurate Card Logging**

We have successfully pivoted from the complex pricing/resolution system to focus **100% on camera integration and accurate card logging**. Here's what's been implemented and tested:

---

## ✅ **What's Working (Core Systems)**

### **1. Camera Integration (`src/capture/camera.py`)**
- **Camera initialization** with proper error handling
- **Frame stabilization** (5-frame averaging for clear captures)
- **Card detection** using contour analysis and perspective correction
- **ROI visualization** (green box for name, blue box for collector number)
- **High-resolution capture** (1920x1080) with autofocus
- **Context manager** for proper resource cleanup

### **2. OCR System (`src/ocr/extract.py`)**
- **Region-specific extraction** (name: 5-14% height, number: 88-98% height)
- **Advanced preprocessing**:
  - Name: Bilateral filter + adaptive threshold + morphological cleanup
  - Number: Median blur + Otsu thresholding + inversion
- **Regex validation** for collector numbers (`\b\d{1,3}\s*/\s*\d{1,3}\b`)
- **Confidence scoring** (name: 60% weight, number: 40% weight)
- **Text validation** (length, character content, format)

### **3. Data Logging (`src/store/logger.py`)**
- **Comprehensive CSV logging** with exact schema
- **Image storage** (organized by scan ID)
- **Detailed JSON logs** with preprocessing steps
- **Scan statistics** (success rate, confidence averages)
- **Export functionality** for data analysis

### **4. CLI Interface (`src/cli.py`)**
- **Rich terminal interface** with progress bars and tables
- **Real-time feedback** during scanning
- **Confidence-based recommendations** for rescanning
- **Comprehensive error handling** and user guidance
