[2025-01-12 07:00:00] [TASK 9.1] DONE – OCR fallback for collector number extraction implemented successfully. Updated src/ocr/extract.py to use ROI_NAME and ROI_NUMBER constants from constants.py, integrated COLLECTOR_NUMBER_PATTERN from regexes module for consistency, and added comprehensive tests in tests/test_ocr.py covering ROI constants usage, noisy input handling, failure cases, edge cases, and Tesseract configuration validation. All 15 OCR tests passing, confirming minimal OCR fallback with Tesseract --psm 7 and whitelist 0123456789/ for collector number extraction when visual confidence is low.
[2025-08-12 07:03:30] [TASK 2] DONE – Vision Embedder implemented successfully. Created src/vision/embedder.py with OpenCLIP ViT-B-32 embedding using ViT-B-32 model with openai pretrained weights, automatic device selection (MPS on Apple Silicon, CUDA if available, else CPU), L2 normalization producing (1, 512) float32 vectors, and comprehensive test suite in tests/test_vision_embedder.py with 5 test cases covering initialization, random image embedding, consistency, different image sizes, and device selection. All tests passing, dependencies (torch, torchvision, open_clip_torch) properly installed and verified working with both synthetic and real images.
[2025-08-12 07:09:30] [TASK 4] DONE – ANN Search and ORB Re-ranking implemented successfully. Created src/match/ module with AnnIndex class for HNSW index loading/searching, ORB keypoint keypoint matching with RANSAC homography in rerank.py, and confidence scoring combining distance + inliers in score.py. All 5 tests passing, module imports correctly, ready for visual search with re-ranking verification.
[2025-01-12 05:00:00] [TASK 5] DONE – Resolver and Pricing Mapper implemented successfully. Created simplified src/resolve/poketcg.py with async HTTP client, exponential backoff (0.2s→1s→3s), get_card() and search_by_number_name() functions, and src/pricing/poketcg_prices.py with map_price_blocks() function for TCGPlayer/CardMarket price flattening. Updated all import files to use new simplified API. All 13 tests passing (7 pricing + 6 resolver), confirming robust resolver with backoff and pricing flattening to fixed fields.
[2025-08-12 15:30:00] [TASK 6] DONE – Capture Warp Overlay implemented successfully. Updated src/capture/overlay.py to use ROI_NAME and ROI_NUMBER constants from constants.py, updated src/capture/warp.py to use WARP_W and WARP_H constants, updated src/capture/camera.py to use constants for centralized constants, SPACE/ESC controls working, perspective warp to fixed size (900x1260), and ROI overlays (top name band, bottom number band) functioning correctly. Headless tests passing, ready for camera integration.
[2025-08-12 16:15:00] [TASK 7] DONE – CSV Writer and Cache implementation completed successfully. Enhanced src/store/writer.py with test isolation support (optional output_dir parameter), fixed test fixtures in tests/test_csv_writer.py to use temporary directories, updated tests/test_cache.py to use ResolvedCard instead of PokemonCard and fixed PriceData instantiation with proper parameters. All 27 tests passing (12 CSV writer + 15 cache), confirming fixed-schema CSV rows with exact header order, minimal SQLite cache for idempotent pricing/card writes, and proper test isolation.
[2025-08-12 15:49:00] [TASK 8] DONE – CLI Flows implementation completed successfully. Added missing build-index command to src/cli.py that delegates to reference builder, implemented all three required commands: build-index (delegates to reference builder), run (one-pass capture→warp→embed→ANN search→ORB re-rank→confidence→resolve→price→CSV append→beep→next), scan/price (batch processing with rate limiting). All commands working correctly with --help, dry-run import path works without camera, CLI properly integrated with shared constants/types and writer/cache modules as specified in prompt.
[2025-01-12 12:00:00] [TASK 10] DONE – Resolver Fallback Number Name implementation completed successfully. Updated src/cli.py to add resolver fallback logic when visual confidence is below CONFIDENCE_REVIEW threshold (0.70). When confidence < confidence_threshold but >= CONFIDENCE_REVIEW, shows warning; when confidence < CONFIDENCE_REVIEW, attempts resolver fallback using OCR-extracted collector number and name via search_by_number_name(). Fallback card bypasses normal resolution flow and goes directly to pricing and CSV writing, maintaining fixed schema and one row per card. Added comprehensive tests in tests/test_cli_fallback.py covering success, failure, and exception scenarios. All 4 tests passing, confirming fallback path takes OCR number and resolves to valid card_id.

[2025-01-12 13:00:00] [TASK 11] DONE – Error Handling and Logging implementation completed successfully. Created comprehensive error handling system with custom exception classes (PokemonScannerError, ConfigurationError, CaptureError, OCRError, ResolutionError, PricingError, CacheError, WriterError, NetworkError), centralized error handling utilities (handle_error, safe_execute, validate_required_fields), retry decorators with exponential backoff (retry, retry_with_context), and input validation utilities (validate_file_path, validate_directory_path, validate_url, validate_api_key, validate_numeric_range, validate_string_length, validate_enum_value, sanitize_filename). All 20 error handler tests and 22 retry tests passing, confirming robust error reporting, graceful failure handling, and retry mechanisms for transient failures. Error handling provides structured logging with context information for debugging and monitoring.
