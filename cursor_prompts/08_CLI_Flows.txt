You are my senior Python pair programmer.
Use THINK → PLAN → APPLY → TEST and log to TASKLOG.md.

GOAL
Wire CLI with commands: `build-index`, `run` (one-pass), `scan`/`price` (batch). Visual matching primary.

THINK
`run` should: capture → warp → embed → ANN search → ORB re-rank → confidence → resolve → price → CSV append → beep → next.

PLAN
- `src/cli.py` (Typer):
  - `build-index`: delegate to reference builder.
  - `run`: loop with camera; implement minimal console prompts if confidence < threshold.
  - `scan`: save warped image + timestamp to queue (SQLite scans).
  - `price`: process NEW scans with small sleep (rate limit).

APPLY
Implement `src/cli.py` per plan, importing shared constants/types and writer/cache modules.

TEST
- `python -m src.cli --help` shows commands.
- Dry-run (without camera) path import works; you may guard camera code under `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
