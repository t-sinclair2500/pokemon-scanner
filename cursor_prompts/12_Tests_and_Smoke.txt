You are my senior Python pair programmer.
Use THINK → PLAN → APPLY → TEST and log to TASKLOG.md.

GOAL
Add small, deterministic tests for pricing flattening, writer header order, resolver backoff, and OCR number parsing.

THINK
We don't need full integration tests; just key units that prevent regressions.

PLAN
- `tests/test_pricing.py`: verify fallback order (normal → holofoil → reverse) and missing fields.
- `tests/test_writer.py`: assert fixed header and column order; price_sources JSON string.
- `tests/test_resolve_backoff.py`: mock 429 → 200 sequence.
- `tests/test_ocr_regex.py`: collector number parsing cases.

APPLY
Implement tests using pytest and simple fixtures.

TEST
- `pytest -q` passes.
