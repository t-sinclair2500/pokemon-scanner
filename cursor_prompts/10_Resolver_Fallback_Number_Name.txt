You are my senior Python pair programmer.
Use THINK → PLAN → APPLY → TEST and log to TASKLOG.md.

GOAL
If visual confidence is below review threshold and OCR finds collector number, refine with resolver search-by-number (+ optional name).

THINK
Use `search_by_number_name(number, name)` and prefer exact number match; rank by name when provided.

PLAN
- In `src/cli.py` run loop: when confidence < CONFIDENCE_REVIEW, call OCR for number; if found, call resolver search; accept best result or prompt user to pick.

APPLY
Wire the fallback logic; ensure CSV still uses fixed schema and one row per card.

TEST
- Mock resolver response; verify path takes OCR number and resolves to a valid card_id.
