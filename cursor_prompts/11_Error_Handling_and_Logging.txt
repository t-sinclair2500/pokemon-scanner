You are my senior Python pair programmer.
Use THINK → PLAN → APPLY → TEST and log to TASKLOG.md.

GOAL
Implement comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the Pokemon scanner application to ensure robust operation and debugging capabilities.

THINK
The application needs systematic error handling for network failures, OCR failures, file I/O errors, and configuration issues. Logging should provide structured information for debugging and monitoring.

PLAN
- `src/utils/error_handler.py`: Centralized error handling with custom exception classes
- `src/utils/retry.py`: Retry decorator with exponential backoff for transient failures
- `src/utils/validation.py`: Input validation and sanitization utilities
- Update existing modules to use structured error handling and logging
- Add error handling tests to verify graceful degradation

APPLY
Implement error handling utilities and integrate them throughout the codebase.

TEST
- All error handling tests pass
- Logging provides structured debug information
- Application gracefully handles failures without crashing
