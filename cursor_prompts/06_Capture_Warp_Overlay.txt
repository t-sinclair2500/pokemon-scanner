You are my senior Python pair programmer.
Use THINK → PLAN → APPLY → TEST and log to TASKLOG.md.

GOAL
Implement capture loop with SPACE/ESC, perspective warp to fixed size, and ROI overlays (top name band, bottom number band).

THINK
We need a stable, simple operator UI: on SPACE capture, warp, then pass onward; two translucent ROI bars help framing.

PLAN
- `src/capture/camera.py`: open camera, draw overlays, SPACE to capture, ESC to exit.
- `src/capture/warp.py`: detect largest quadrilateral, warp to (WARP_W, WARP_H).
- `src/capture/overlay.py`: draw ROI rectangles using constants.

APPLY
Implement these modules (fill stubs if present) using names from constants:
- WARP_W, WARP_H
- ROI_NAME, ROI_NUMBER

TEST
- Headless import check.
- Manual smoke later.
